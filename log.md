# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my web publishing homework which was creating a css style sheet. I completed the flexbox challenges and grid challenges on free code camp. I also finished the first responsive web project which was to create a tribute page.

**Thoughts:** I have learned a lot of new things in CSS that I did not know before. It has been really helpful with my classes.
